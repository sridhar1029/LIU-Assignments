Abstract

In the current situation, the world is surrounded by news articles. There are hundreds of publications for News articles in America alone, and each publication has a
different agenda for publishing news articles. As a part of my Text mining project, I chose to analyse the news articles from some of the American publications, to see if we can successfully identify the publication from the content of the news article. The topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the numerical statistic for textual data, Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, were used to generate features for the classifiers. The performance of these features was evaluated using two classifiers, Multinomial Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. The aim of this project was to compare the performance of the feature generating algorithms, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, on the News Articles dataset. Experimental results show that the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency gives a better overall accuracy with both the classifiers on the News articles dataset.
